[GitHub is a popular cloud service](https://datascientest.com/en/github-what-is-it) that allows developers to store and share code. It also enables tracking and managing changes made to the code.

One of its primary features is version control **through Git:** an open-source distributed system that simplifies branching and merging of projects. As a result, the entire codebase and history of a project are available on the computer of every participating developer.

As a [cloud-based Git code repository service,](https://datascientest.com/en/cloud-data-engineer-course-the-best-options) GitHub is an excellent solution for collaboration among multiple developers on a software project.

The widespread adoption of Git by software developers is an advantage for GitHub, as this cloud-based code repository ensures that projects are accessible to other developers.

GitHub is used by developers and companies to build, deliver, and maintain software. It facilitates collaboration and code sharing, as well as tracking changes throughout the project. This is particularly useful for understanding the origins of bugs.
