Within the **Azure DevOps suite,** Pipelines is a service **entirely dedicated to CI/CD.** It is a mature and comprehensive tool that manages both continuous integration and continuous delivery.

It has been used for a long time for various .NET projects.

This solution allows for the creation of workflows capable of building, testing, publishing, releasing, and deploying code automatically, providing end-to-end traceability of the software development lifecycle.

Every three weeks, [Microsoft continues to improve its tool](https://datascientest.com/en/tutorial-power-bi-learn-how-to-use-the-bi-tool-by-microsoft) by adding new features to Azure Pipelines.

[**There are two different types of pipelines in Azure DevOps:**](https://datascientest.com/en/azure-devops-definitions-devops-methods) build pipelines for constructing artifacts, and release pipelines for deploying a build artifact to an environment.

There are two methods for defining build pipelines: classic and YAML. With the classic method, the defined pipeline is stored on Azure DevOps and not in the repository. The YAML method serializes the pipeline as a YAML file in the repository.
