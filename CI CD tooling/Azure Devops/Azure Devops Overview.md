[Azure DevOps](https://datascientest.com/en/azure-devops-definitions-devops-methods) is a collection of services designed for developers on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

It’s created to assist developers in building software by simplifying planning, collaboration, communication, and the deployment of new projects.

The various services within this suite can be used separately or combined. The collection includes Azure Pipelines, Azure Repos, and Azure Test Plans, among others.

This set of solutions provides all the necessary tools for hosting source code repositories, implementing continuous integration, and delivering and testing workflows for products before releasing them.

Azure DevOps is used for planning and collaboration in code development, as well as for building and deploying applications. [In comparison to GitHub](https://datascientest.com/en/github-course-mastering-the-platform-made-easy), Azure DevOps is generally preferred by businesses.
