the Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) toolkit, 
which includes tools for discovering and documenting your SQL Servers.

Use MAP to scan your landscape and return the names of the SQL Server instances it finds, along with the version and edition, and installed components. You view this data graphically to easily consume the results. MAP also audits the operating system and hardware, instance settings, and settings for each database.

All this data can be exported to Microsoft Excel to filter it and further visualize the results. Using these results, you know the target databases that need an upgrade. Run the toolkit on a regular basis to find any changes. You can then report back to your managers, or quickly answer questions from developers.

Your law firm has a complex mix of well-documented databases run by professional DBAs and smaller databases, with little or no documentation, run by people who have other jobs.

MAP is ideal in such circumstances. Because MAP discovers databases automatically, you can start to document your landscape without talking to all the people who run the databases.

Auditing the current database landscape and assessing how databases are used, will guide you towards an appropriate upgrade solution. The process will help you plan a migration, is useful for finding databases that are no longer used, and for cleaning up your database environment.

In practice, most organizations discover their landscape only as needed and their documentation doesn't exist or it's out of date. The MAP toolkit is ideal for doing an audit of your landscape, especially when you're thinking about database upgrades. It removes tedious and repetitive tasks that steal valuable administrator time.
