Azure Migrate provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Azure. All pre-migration steps such as discovery, assessments, and right-sizing of on-premises resources are included for infrastructure, data, and applications. Azure Migrateâ€™s extensible framework allows for integration of third-party tools, thus expanding the scope of supported use-cases.
